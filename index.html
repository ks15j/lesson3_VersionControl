            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The internet is a complex entity that uses a number of complex steps in order to work properly. The first step is departure, in this step, you type in a URL into a web browser. Then, your computer connects to the internet through a router/modem. This filters through incoming and outgoing data. After this occurs, the query (searched term or URL) is submitted to your internet service provider. Then, the DNS (domain name system) translates the URL to an IP address. At that point, your browser maps itself to that IP address, and establishes the http. Then the computer connects with the server hosting the IP in order to access the website. A connection is established and then your computer will be able to access the website. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A static web page is a web page that is delivered to the user the same way it has been stored. This is different from dynamic web pages because they are generated by a web application. Additionally, static web pages display the exact same information to all users that access it. Static web pages are most commonly HTML documents stored as files, and made available to a web server via HTTP. Typically, static web pages are used when the data the contain may not need to be updated. Further, using dynamic web pages has several advantages. For one, they are more secure than dynamic web sites, they have improved usability, and aren’t dependent on any systems such a database. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A server-side dynamic web page is controlled by an application server, which processes server-side scripts. Parameters will determine how to web page is displayed. A client-side dynamic webpage, however can process a web page by using HTML scripting. Here the browser runs as it is loaded. Languages like JavaScript are then used to determine how the HTML is displayed on the webpage. The dynamic website can then dynamically update or change based upon the websites code. Updated code could then come from the pages Data Object Model, or from the websites server. </p>

            <p class="lead">must have a unique identifier. This is known as an IP address. IP addresses are usually in the form: nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn. Each number ‘nnn’ must be between 0-255. If you are connecting to the internet through an internet service provider, most times you will be assigned a temporary IP address. However, if you connect to the internet through a LAN, your computer could have a permanent IP address, or it could pick one out of a pool of available IPs through DHCP. Either way, if you’re connected to the internet, you will have a unique address that will identify your device. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Internet Protocol & Packets</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Devices connected to the internet are able to speak to each other through the use of a protocol stack. Every computer needs a protocol stack in order to connect to other devices. This capability is almost always built into a computers operating system. The protocol stack that’s used on the internet is known as the TCP/IP protocol stack, and it uses the two major communication protocols. Typically, when using protocol stacks the message would start at the top of the protocol stack on your devise and eventually move downward. The packets of data then go through the application layer and continue to the TCP layer. Then the packets continue onto the IP layer. Once the message packets have their appropriate IP address and port number, they will be sent over the internet. The hardware layer then turns the packers into electronic signals and are transmitted elsewhere. Then, the ISPS router examines the destination address in each packet and determines where is should be sent. </p>
